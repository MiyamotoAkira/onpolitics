sum: There is a lack of follow up on the Commons
title: MPs Not Following Up
---

Lately, I've been listening a lot to Commons proceedings. You know, they are making my life more difficult, they are chasing away companies, so I decided to better check what happens within the House of Commons.

It is not the first time that I've heard parliamentary proceedings. During the IndyRef I did listen to a few parliamentary commisions. As a side note, the amount and depth of them, compared to what was done for the Brexit vote, is very interesting. I think all the parliamentary sessions that have been happening after should have happened before.

I come from Spain, where we have a written constitution and the laws are also fully codified, so finding that UK was this set of disperse rules and customs it was surprising back then. Even the famous Erskine May (Â£329.99 to buy!!! ... and still tempted) is just a collection of how procedure evolved and the conventions of parliament. But well used it would be a very flexible system. Being able to react quicker to changing times, rather than the complications of a written constitution from 50, 100 or 200 years back, which would never be up to the task. Of course, that would require people wanting to change as needed ... and neither the Conservatives (expected) nor Labour (a bit unexpected) seem to care about changing at any point ever.
